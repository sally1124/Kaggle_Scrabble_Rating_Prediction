# Scrabble_Player_Rating_Prediction
### Project Introduction
In this project, we aimed to develop a predictive model that can estimate a Scrabble player's rating before engaging in a game. To accomplish this, we utilized gameplay data sourced from Woogles.io, an online platform for playing Scrabble. This dataset was instrumental in training and testing our model to ensure optimal performance. Our evaluation metric of choice was the root mean squared error (RMSE), which quantifies the average difference between predicted and actual ratings.

### What's Scrabble?
Scrabble, a classic two-person crossword board game, involves strategically placing letter tiles on the board to form words, with players earning points based on various factors like word length and board positioning.

### Model Development Approach
To create a model geared towards minimizing the root mean squared error (RMSE), we implemented the following methodologies:

Feature Engineering:
We delved into the realm of feature engineering, exploring novel and original features to identify those with the most significant impact on prediction accuracy.

Model Comparison:
Our exploration extended to testing five distinct algorithms, each bringing its unique strengths to the table. The algorithms included in our comparative analysis were:
1. Linear Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Decision Trees
4. Random Forest
5. XGBoost
Through rigorous testing, we identified and selected the best-performing model from this diverse set, ensuring optimal predictive capabilities for Scrabble player ratings.
